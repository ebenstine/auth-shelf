Notes: for getting shelf

[x]We need to go to  Redux folder
 setup shelf.reducer.js > this will hold the state piece similar to basic index.js
 
[x]Need to go to sagas folder
 setup shelf.saga.js > this will hold fetch function as well as shelf function
 
 [x]Go to sagas > root.saga folder and import shelf.saga and add the saga to the yield
 Go to redux > root.reducer and import shelf reducer and then add to combine reducer
 
[x]Need to import root reducer and root saga
